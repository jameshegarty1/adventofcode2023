We have some "maps" which show how to navigate the desert.

RL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)



The instructions are "RL"

We start at "AAA".

Insruction "R" means take the right element of AAA = (BBB,CCC) -> CCC

Now we are at "CCC"

Instruction "L" means take the left element of CC = (ZZZ,GGG) -> ZZZ


Once we arrive at ZZZ, we are finished.


If it didn't work, and we didn't reach ZZZ, then we re-set the instructions and carry on.

Hence "RL" really means "RLRLRLRLRL..." until ZZZ is reached.
