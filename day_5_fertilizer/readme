Each line within a map contains three numbers: the destination range start, the source range start, and the range length.

Consider again the example seed-to-soil map:

50 98 2
52 50 48


so we have:

seeds-to soil:

98,99
->
50,51

50-97
->
52-99


Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10.
