We have a map such as:

..F7.
.FJ|.
SJ.L7
|F--J
LJ...

The starting point is S.

We need to find the main loop, which we can do by going either side from S until pointers meet each other.


Rules:

| is a vertical pipe connecting north and south.
- is a horizontal pipe connecting east and west.
L is a 90-degree bend connecting north and east.
J is a 90-degree bend connecting north and west.
7 is a 90-degree bend connecting south and west.
F is a 90-degree bend connecting south and east.
. is ground; there is no pipe in this tile.
