Have data like this where each row shows the change of a measurement over time:

0 3 6 9 12 15
1 3 6 10 15 21
10 13 16 21 30 45


Task: predict the next value for each measure


Can be done like this using sequences of difference until all are 0's:

0   3   6   9  12  15
  3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0



The add another 0, and unknowns for the others:


0   3   6   9  12  15   B
  3   3   3   3   3   A
    0   0   0   0   0

A = 0 (left) + 3 (below) = 3
B = 15 + 3 = 18

0   3   6   9  12  15  18
  3   3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0   0



Need to find all next elements, then add them up.
